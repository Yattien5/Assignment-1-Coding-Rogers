3D printing started as a niche market for toys and models but has recently been expanding rapidly into business projects that are rapidly affecting our society. A 
massive project undertaken by stakeholders in 3D printing technology is building homes using 3D equipment. The Italian based company WASP (World Advanced Saving Project) 
was one of the first companies to deal with 3D printing earthen materials for smaller projects which eventually divulged into printing homes using these methods. Since 
2017, WASP undertook two different projects producing products out of earthen materials using 3D technology. The first was using natural mixtures of local origin without 
any type of chemicals and printing load-bearing elements. The second project aimed to create a circular building model made of reusable and recyclable materials. The 
desired outcome for each project was to successfully produce a product capable of passing multiple tests necessary to create livable housing structures using 3D printed 
earthen materials.

The project managers tested various materials and building methods to create load-bearing structures tested for durability and reliability in various settings. The data 
was then combined into a portfolio which showcased a multitude of testing that concluded that compressive strength of 3D-printed earthen elements are comparable to that 
of traditional rammed-earth buildings. These structures in-fact offered a greater value of use due to their ability to be filled in without many complications other 
traditional materials might have. The value of WASP's in-depth analysis opened opportunities for more companies to begin their own experiments into 3D printing homes and 
structures which has made significant progress in areas desperate for affordable housing.

Elements that made this IT/business project a success include the project manager's ability to set a clearly defined project standard and uphold their objectives with 
tangible results which produced a favorable outcome that achieved a new state of understanding for the future of their project. Additionally, the compiled data showcased 
different building methods from 3D printed structures in a measurable way and reported achievable results. The combination of testing and documenting created a portfolio 
to present findings associated with their project to back their future development of 3D printed structures. Finally, the project provided relevant information that 
identified to stakeholders the beneficial nature of the project to avoid wasting time and resources on future projects. Overall, the 3D printing of homes by WASP was a 
successful example of a good IT/business project.
